This is the computational part of the Degrees Of Sound App, where the real work happens.

Right now, it VERY slow....but it works. This slowness is due to the latency of using the soundcloud API...some kind of caching is needed.

TODO:
-Clean up code and make it more OO
-Look into some kind of multithreading
-Look into caching results
